**Modern Delight** is a mod that aims to expand Minecraft with more modern ways of cooking food, introducing a simpler power system on top of that, where you can power your kitchen appliances by building some power generating facilities. So far, the mod allows you to use a whick to mix or whip up a whole new range of foods, an oven to bake different ingredients, a freezer to cold process foods, a kneading stick to make pizzas, a traditional bamboo steamer or an electric steamer to steam foods, and an ice cream maker to produce delicious and customizable ice cream flavors! You can produce biogas by fermenting it in a digester and burn it to heat up blocks and even yourself! You can also use oil extraction from vegetables, which in turn enables fried foods! There are many more details and contents of the mod waiting for you to explore!

### This mod is currently under development, backup your saves often.
